**Today's Progress**: 1) Free Code Camp, Intermediate Algorithm Scripting -- Algorithm 20(Everything Be True)
                      2) Free Code Camp, Intermediate Algorithm Scripting -- Algorithm 21(Arguments Optional)

**Thoughts:** Learned the js function every() for an Array. It checks if all elements of the Array pass a test.       https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_every.asp
              Also learned about closures which are functions that remember their environment. https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_closures.asp
